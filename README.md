# Goal
To use AI to address the following issues:
- It takes lots of time to find good healthy recipes that
- It takes even more time to put recipes together in a way to meet budget needs and other needs (such as macros)
- It is difficult to combine recipes together to be as efficient as possible with groceries (I dont want to buy anything that will go to waste)
- If someone is able to make and awesome meal plan for the week, using the same recipes week after week lose their novelty. Ideally one would be able to control adding in new and exciting recipes seamlessly without the time, budget, and optimization challenges mentioned above

# Pattern
This pattern can be re-used for desigining multi-agentic systems to optimize decision intelligence across a variety of constraints (ex constraints include budget, time, resource utilization efficiency, talent)

# Architecture
- The cornerstone of this project will be Microsoft Agent Framework (Python), an SDK for designing, organizing, and collaborating AI agents athat can take full advantage of leading open-source integrations (such as MCP, AG-UI, and A2A)
- Microsoft Foundry will be the model, agent, and (some) tool hosting
